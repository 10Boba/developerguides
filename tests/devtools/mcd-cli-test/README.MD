## MCD-CLI Test    
This test checks the [mcd-cli guide](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/devtools/mcd-cli/mcd-cli-guide-01/mcd-cli-guide-01.md) against the mcd-cli tool to see if there's any breaking changes.     
The `test` folder has necessary files to run the test.     

Make sure to install the `mcd-cli` tool first before running the test. 
To run the tests, run `bats test.bats` command and the test will start.

# Tests
 
This folder is intended to keep track of any breaking changes in the source code that resides in our guides.    
If a test fails, we need to update the code or dependencies where relevant. 

### Steps
1 - run `npm install` to get necessary dependencies.    
2 - run `npm test` to run the tests.

**Note:** some tests might need other resources to run in the background.     
Example: To run the `test-chain-guide` test, you must run the testchain instance before running the test.
